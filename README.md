# The Player

Keyboards and Movement:

* The player controls the plate by clicking and dragging the mouse and decides which direction in the X-axis it will move (left or right).

* space key - Release the ball up.

Boundries:

* The player cant get out from the screen (Right or Left).

Player Collision:

* Extra life - If the player break a brick there is a chance that extra life will fall down from the brick, if the player will collect him, he will get extra life (animation in "Bricks");

* Ball - if the ball hits the player(plate) the ball will fly in a certain direction.

# The Ball

Ball Collision:

* With Botton - if the ball reachs the bottom he will rebooted to player position.

* With Brick - the brick life points will go by 1.

* With Boundries - the ball will fly in a certain direction.

Boundries:

* The Ball cant get out from the screen boundaries(left,right,top)

# Bricks

Every brick as life points of its own that if they go down to 0, the brick will will explode.

There are 2 types of bricks - "brick", and "last brick":

* brick - if the player will destroy the brick, another brick will showed up with different color, and if the second brick will expload - the "last brick" will showed up in a different color.

* last brick - if the player will destroy the last brick he will get 1 points to the score.
 
 animations (expload last brick and extra life):
